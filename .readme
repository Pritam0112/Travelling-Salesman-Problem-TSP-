The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) involves finding the shortest route that visits each city once and returns to the origin. This project focuses on learning and modeling the TSP with an emphasis on parameter tuning, warm start techniques, and heuristics. It explores strategies including business intelligence methods to prioritize nearby cities, aiming to enhance solution efficiency. By integrating these approaches, the project seeks to improve route optimization and solve TSP more effectively.
